      <h2>Q. Who are you?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: My name is Spandan Kumar Sahu, fifth year, dual degree student from Computer Science and Engineering Department. I did my internship at Tower Research Capital, Gurgaon, in summers 2019. Prior to that I had completed GSoC in summers 2017, and went for an internship at ITRI Taiwan in summers 2018.</h2>
      <h2>Q. What is the Selection Procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: The selection procedure is a resume review, followed by rounds of telephonic interview. The whole process is handled by CDC; interview takes place in CDC office and the resumes are directly forwarded by CDC.</h2>
      <h2>Q. How to prepare for them?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: The general process to prepare for a Tower interview is to spotless in your concepts of Algorithms, Operating Systems, Networks and other core courses. Revision from GeeksForGeeks and InterviewBit helps.</h2>
      <h2>Q. What were the Project Details?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: I can't reveal most details of my project, owing to non-disclosure agreement, but it was a project on benchmarking, alerting and monitoring Ceph, a distributed data storage system.</h2>
      <h2>Q. How was the Company culture?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: The company culture is great, with relaxed work timings and a lively office. People there are pretty knowledgeable as almost everyone is a topper of sorts of their respective colleges. They expect you to know your subjects thoroughly, but they will help you out, once you exhaust all your ideas.</h2>
      <h2>Q. Who should ideally apply for the internship?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: Tower is pretty exclusive when it comes to interns selection from KGP. It almost always sticks to CS majors with CG in the upwards of 9.5. Either that, or you have to be good at something very specific they are looking at. From my understanding, they are currently looking for UI/UX developers, competitive programmers and people with experience in cloud computing.</h2>
      <h2>Q. Any advice?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: Tower isn't a traditional software company, and is a relatively small team for the variety of domains they play in. So be prepared to face a wider variety of challenges, and learn to have fun solving them:)</h2>
