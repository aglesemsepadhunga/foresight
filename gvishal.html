      <h2>Q. Who are you?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: My name is G.Vishal. I am a 4th year student of the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering.I interned at Goldman Sachs in the Risk division this summer.</h2>
      <h2>Q. What is the Selection Procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: First, there was a written test consisting of some basic programming questions and some
objective type questions on Prob. Stats. and basic CS.
It was followed by 4 rounds of interviews, which was based on Probability and Stats. and
some puzzles.
I didn't have any programming interviews as such.</h2>
      <h2>Q. How to prepare for them?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: I think one can do well in the interview with some revision of the basics of Probability
Statistics and having some practice on the same topic.
Doing some Coding practice would also help a lot, in general.Geeks for Geeks is a good
resource for both in my opinion.</h2>
<h2>Q. What were the Project Details?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: My project consisted of creating a new benchmarking model for the existing  CVA(credit
valuation) calculation system using Neural Networks.It consisted of a lot of math and also
needed programming skills.I liked my project because, instead of working on some dummy
project, I got to work on a project which I personally felt had a lot of scope for impact.</h2>
<h2>Q. How was the Company culture?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: The most amazing thing about the company, is it’s culture.The people are really amazing,
they are very approachable and friendly as well.I always felt very comfortable with them.GS
has a very flat culture, which I felt was really impressive.</h2>
<h2>Q. Who should ideally apply for the internship?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: People who like math, quant and want to have an idea of the financial services sector should
definitely apply for this internship, as it was surely a very good learning experience for me.</h2>
<h2>Q. Any advice?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: I don’t think I am qualified enough to dole out advice in general :), but one thing I would like
to say is that, believing in oneself really helps a lot. </h2>
