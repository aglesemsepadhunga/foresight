      <h2>Q. Who are you?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: Being a student of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department, I had a very few options in
core. This was known to me almost since my first year, thus I decided to go for non-core from the
beginning.  I would suggest each one of you know about the scope and opportunities in your
department before deciding which profile to choose. During one of my internships, I was able to
explore the field  Data Analytics and from there I decided to continue in the same.</h2>
      <h2>Q. What is the Selection Procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: Students from all the departments are eligible to apply.  There was no CGPA cutoff.<br><br>
Online Test: <br><br>
An online test with 20 MCQ questions is conducted once you apply. The test was quite easy. It
consisted of questions on basic probability, mathematical aptitude, verbal and non-verbal reasoning
and data interpretation. Make sure that you don't commit silly mistakes. Around 10 people were
shortlisted for the next round.<br><br>
Technical Round: <br><br>
It started with a generic question, &quot; Tell me about yourself&quot;. The discussion started with my previous
internship at  HDFC Bank, Mumbai. Then, the discussion revolved around the Boosting Algorithms.
Among other people who were shortlisted, some were given questions related to guesstimates and
probability to solve along with some puzzles.<br><br>
Technical Round + HR:<br><br>
This round again began with my introduction and a brief explanation about my previous projects.
Since AmEx and HDFC Bank deal in credit card, a major part of this round involved discussing my
work at HDFC Bank. I was asked about some suggestion/new ideas as to how the data AmEx
currently has can be used. Then, we moved towards my work at EY. Here, I had directly used the
fuzzy-wuzzy library. So, I was asked to give the logic for building it from scratch. Then came the
question, &#39; Why should we hire you?&#39; and &#39;Why Amex?&#39;. Be prepared for these questions.</h2>
      <h2>Q. How to prepare for them?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: 1. Be thorough with your CV. Don&#39;t write a description about your internships that you can&#39;t explain. 
<br> 2. Be prepared for questions like strengths, weakness, why should we hire you?, etc. Think about
these questions properly and tell them about actually why they should take you and what sets you
apart. The interviewer has been in tons of interviews and will easily catch the generic answers.
<br> 3. Keep practicing aptitude questions and puzzles online on websites like IndiaBix. Also, brush up
your concepts related to Probability. 
<br> 4. Be comfortable with at least one programming language preferably Python.
<br> 5. Know about the company before walking into the interview.
<br><br>
Most of the interns, including me, were in allocated the Gurgaon office while a few got the Bangalore
one. The Gurgaon office seats over 6000 employees distributed across the 3 major divisions -
Enterprise and Digital Analytics (EDA), Credit and Fraud Risk (CFR) and Technology. I was a part of
the International Line Modelling Team from CFR with my job title as Credit and Risk Decision Science
Intern.<br><br>
My office was in One Horizon Center building. The workspace is amazing and has been laid out quite
creatively. All the interns were taken out for fun event at Canvas Laugh Club so that we get to know
each other. The company provides you with accommodation for 1 week and bears your travel
expenses at the beginning and end of the internship. Also, the company provides transportation every
day anywhere in Delhi NCR region. The number of working days was 5 with timings being specific for
a particular team. Team specific fun events and offsite trips to nearby locations happen once a year. 
<br><br>
The best thing about AmEx has to be the people there. On the first day itself, we got to interact with
the senior leaders of the company, who were really welcoming. The Director and the VP of my team
got really involved in the work I was doing and we used to have regular brain-storming sessions. Also,
the team members really looked out for each other and were quite helpful. I had a great time
discussing everything and anything over lunch with my team. The HR people also made some efforts
to arrange sessions with top executives from India and the US offices</h2>
<h2>Q. What were the Project Details?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: Every intern was allowed a different project to work on. Each one of us had a mentor to guide us as
the project proceeded. I was part of the International Line Modelling team. My team worked on
delivering the models that would help the company decide which customer should be allotted what
credit limit on the credit card. My project was an exploratory one wherein we were developing a
dynamic model that would take personalized parameters and weights for each customer. I had to
build this model for the US market. Thus, the person to whom my manager reported was in New York
and we would discuss the progress of my project usually through Skype. I was solely working on this
project under guidance from my mentor. I had written all the codes in Python which were completely
automatic. But, most of my co-interns worked on SAS.</h2>
<h2>Q. What you liked the most about your internship?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: My manager/mentor leveraged the comfort that I had with Python or else it would have taken me
some time to get comfortable with SAS. My inputs were always considered even though due the time
crunch everything could not be implemented. My teammates would always be ready to give me
fundas be it related to my project, career or any other thing. My mentor would always motivate me
and guide me as to how to look towards the problem statement with a more analytical view. I have
learnt innumerable things throughout this internship and listing all of them in one blog is just not
possible.</h2>
<h2>Q. Any advice?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: In the end, I am glad that I was able to contribute to the project. The most important thing that I have
learnt is that whatever you do, give it your best shot. Try to pitch in new ideas/methods for your
project and interact with the people as much as possible. They are obviously more experienced and
it’ll definitely develop your social skills. Look at this internship as a golden opportunity and make the
most of it in every way possible</h2>
