      <h2>Q. Who are you?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: Hi! I am Rajat Goel, I did my Internship at ITC during the summers of 2019. ITC is one of India's
foremost private sector companies with a market capitalization of INR 3.74
trillion and a turnover of INR 550 billion. ITC is rated among the World's Best Big Companies,
Asia's 'Fab 50' and the World's Most Reputable Companies by Forbes magazine and among India's
Most Valuable Companies by Business Today. ITC has a diversified presence in FMCG, Hotels,
Paperboards & Specialty Papers, Packaging, Agri-Business, and Information Technology.</h2>
      <h2>Q. What is the Selection Procedure?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: For the students of top-notch colleges (IITs, IIMs etc.), a program names KITES is launched every
year. The selection procedure of ITC is a bit comprehensive.<br><br>
1. Online Application: Right when the notification appears on the ERP CDC portal, a link is
share directed to a form which has to be filled by the applicant. This form demands minute
details about the individual and some questions to check the basic mental moral of the
applicant. There is usually no rigid CGPA criteria. The ITC team reviews each and every form
and select candidates on the basis of the same.<br><br>
2. Psychometric Test: A test is conducted to check the mental stability and moral values of the
applicant. Usually no one (whose form is shortlisted) is barred at this stage.
3. Group Discussion: FMCG companies like ITC and HUL conducted a Case GD which is quite
different from normal GDs.<br><br>
4. Personal Interview: After clearing the Group Discussion round, the applicant is called for
the personal interview which consists of 2 rounds (technical and HR). Technical questions
involve basic coursework knowledge, past internship experience and basic logical reasoning.
In the HR round, the focus is more towards PORs, extra-curricular, speaking skills etc.</h2>
      <h2>Q. How to prepare for them?</h2>
      <h2 class="ans">Ans: The answers to the fields asked in the internship application form should be honest. For
Psychometric Test, the key is to read the questions carefully, you’ll find same questions asked in
different manners multiple times just to check the mental stability of your mind. For the GD round,
my advice is to search for a few case GD topics online and practice with your friends on the same.
This will help a lot during the final GD. I firm grip on core subjects (the applicant should be ready
with 2 strong subjects) and conceptual clarity is required. Knowledge about the accomplishments
written in the internship form (like the past internship work, academic project) is must for the
interviews.</h2>
<h2>Q. What were the Project Details?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: I was working in the Agri-Business Division of ITC at Guntur, Andhra Pradesh where my major project
was to Digitalise a Spice Processing Facility up to Industry 4.0 standards. This was a critical project as
a capital expenditure of about 175 Cr INR was at stake. The project demanded thorough knowledge
of Spice Processing as well Digitalisation Trends being adopted across industries so I planned and
visited many ITC/non-ITC plants located in different parts of the country including Bangalore, Pune,
Chirala etc. This was a really enriching experience and the best part is all your travel expenses are
handled by ITC itself. I also contacted international vendors through video conferences for fixing
deals and budget finalisation. For these jobs, I was working at the Agri-Business Division HQ at
Guntur. Apart from this I was also assigned 2 minor projects related to facility’s construction phase.</h2>
<h2>Q. How was the Company culture?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: The work culture at ITC is very professional. The corporate exposure that one gets at ITC is
unmatchable in my opinion. People treat you equal to themselves and give importance to your
ideas/inputs instead of treating you like some students who are still studying. Each and every project
is very well thought upon. You are given a feeling of ownership towards the project which makes you
more dedicated towards it. The thing that I liked the most at ITC was “Appreciation for Talent”,
people acknowledge your efforts for any job which makes you feel motivated to deliver more. Apart
from this with a brand name like ITC attached with you, international firms and organisations respect
your designation which also adds to your corporate profile for any future endeavours.<br><br>
For future interns, you’ll enjoy a grand welcome party cum workshop during March/April for the
Intern Summit at Bangalore in one of the finest Luxury-Collection Hotel of ITC (ITC Windsor).</h2>
<h2>Q. Who should ideally apply for the internship?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: In my opinion, someone who wants to experience corporate life to the fullest, learn how big
organisations work should definitely seek for an internship. Someone who wants to utilise the
opportunity instead of enjoying 2 months away from home should seek for the internship. Someone
who not only wants to learn but also make an impact by his/her contribution should definitely seek
for an internship.</h2>
<h2>Q. Any advice?</h2>
<h2 class="ans">Ans: When I got Guntur as my internship location, I was sad as it is not a very great city to chill out. But
now I feel it does not matter at all; what matters at the end if the experience, knowledge and
exposure that you take from the internship. Also, students focus on the high stipend that ITC pays; it
is to be understood that if such a high amount is being paid same amount of efforts should be visible
from your side. Even if you contribute a little, they’ll acknowledge your efforts and surely will offer
you a PPO. Last thing, Keep Calm, SAB PEACE HOGA. Day-1/Day-10 kuch fark nahi padta. BE
MOTIVATED!! </h2>
